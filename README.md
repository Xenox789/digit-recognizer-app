# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognizer Web App (CNN-Powered)

This is a CNN-based handwritten digit recognition app built with **Flask**, **TensorFlow**, and **HTML5 Canvas**.  
Users can draw a digit on a virtual whiteboard, and the app will predict what number they wrote using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the MNIST dataset.
